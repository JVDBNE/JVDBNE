# Hey There! My name is Jess

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer currently working at :rocket: [Xplor Technologies](https://www.xplortechnologies.com/au) as a Jr Software Engineer. 

My world is predominately MySQL / PHP / Java Script based at present, however I am passionate about building SOLID knowledge, cross team collaboration and deep diving into all things tech. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In 2022 I completed a 6 month programming intensive with [She Codes Australia](https://shecodes.com.au/) as part of the Brisbane Plus Cohort and ventured back as a mentor for HTML & CSS in 2023.<br> 
:chart_with_upwards_trend:I'm backing this up with learning tracks and additional projects  with a focus on all things PHP, Laravel, and Vue <br>
