# Hey There! My name is Jess

I'm an aspiring full stack developer working at :rocket: [Xplor Technologies](https://www.xplortechnologies.com/au) as an Application Support Specialist. 

My world is predominately SQL based at present, however I am passionate about building knowledge and deep diving into tech. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm currently completing a 6 month programming intensive with [She Codes Australia](https://shecodes.com.au/) as part of the 2022 Brisbane Plus Cohort.<br> 
:chart_with_upwards_trend:I'm backing this study up with learning tracks and additional projects via [Treehouse Tech](https://teamtreehouse.com/home).<br>
