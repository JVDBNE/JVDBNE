# Hey There! My name is Jess

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer working at :rocket: [Xplor Technologies](https://www.xplortechnologies.com/au) as a Jr Software Engineer. 

My world is predominately SQL / PHP / Java Script based at present, however I am passionate about building knowledge and deep diving into tech.
