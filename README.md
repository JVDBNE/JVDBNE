# Hey There, My name is Jess

I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working at :rocket: [Xplor Technologies](https://www.xplortechnologies.com/au) as a Jr Software Engineer. 

My world is predominately MySQL / PHP / Java Script based at present, however I am passionate about building SOLID knowledge, cross team collaboration and deep diving into all things tech. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In 2022 I completed a 6 month programming intensive with [She Codes Australia](https://shecodes.com.au/) as part of the Brisbane Plus Cohort and ventured back as a mentor for HTML & CSS in 2023.<br> 
:chart_with_upwards_trend:I'm backing this up with learning tracks and additional projects  with a focus on all things PHP, Laravel, and VueJS via Codecademy and LinkedIn Learning.

My Github account is a little light at present due to a strong focus on actively engaging in Professional feature work and increasing my depth of knowledge at work. Since completing several projects and deploying via Heroku, this service has since been interrupted and several are needing to be redeployed.
