# Hey There! My name is Jess

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer working at :rocket: [Xplor Technologies](https://www.xplortechnologies.com/au) as a Jr Software Engineer. 

My world is predominately SQL / PHP / Java Script based at present, however I am passionate about building knowledge and deep diving into tech. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend: In 2022 I completed a 6 month programming intensive with [She Codes Australia](https://shecodes.com.au/) as part of the Brisbane Plus Cohort.<br>
